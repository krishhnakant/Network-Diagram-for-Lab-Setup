# Network-Diagram-for-Lab-Setup
Designed a simulated enterprise network using Microsoft Visio and Draw.io. Included IP allocation, subnetting, VLAN setup, and basic router/firewall configuration. Created detailed diagrams and documentation to showcase network planning skills.

Network Diagram for Lab Setup
-----------------------------

📁 Project Type: Self-Initiated Lab
🖥️ Tools Used: Microsoft Visio, Draw.io (diagrams.net)

🔧 Project Overview:
This project involved designing a simulated enterprise network architecture for learning and portfolio demonstration. Tools like Microsoft Visio and Draw.io were used to create network topology diagrams.

📌 Key Components:
- IP address planning and subnetting
- VLAN segmentation for departments (IT, HR, Sales)
- Gateway and routing design
- Basic firewall placement and configuration simulation
- Visual representation of network components and connections

📂 Folder Structure:
- Diagrams/ → Network diagrams in .vsdx, .drawio, or .png formats
- Documentation/ → Project description and design notes
- Configurations/ → IP & subnet plans, VLAN ID mapping
- Screenshots/ → Visual outputs of the diagrams or tool usage

📈 Outcome:
This lab demonstrates understanding of network planning, logical design, and basic security architecture in a visual and documented format, suitable for IT infrastructure and networking roles.
